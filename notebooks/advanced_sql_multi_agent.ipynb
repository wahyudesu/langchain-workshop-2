    "- Limit results to at most 10 unless customer specifies otherwise\n",

    "- Use proper JOINs to connect music relationships: Track → Album → Artist\n",

    "- Songs by artist: SELECT Track.Name, Album.Title, Artist.Name FROM Track JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId WHERE Artist.Name LIKE '%Rolling Stones%'\n",
    "- Albums by artist: SELECT Album.Title, Artist.Name FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId WHERE Artist.Name LIKE '%Beatles%'\n",

    "- DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.)\n",
    "- Use LIKE with wildcards (%) for flexible artist/song matching\n",
    "- Always include relevant context (artist with song, album with track count, etc.)\n",
    "- If searching fails, try partial matches or similar spellings\n",
    "\n",
    "RESPONDING TO THE USER:\n",
    "- If there are no results, and you're confident the query was correct, just say \"No results found\".\n",
